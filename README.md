  # E-Commerce Back End

  ## Description
  This is a CLI based  app using  Express.js, Node.js, and PostgreSQL to create an E-Commerce database with seeded data. After creating and seeding the database, the user has API GET routes for categories, products, and tags, and when pulled are displayed in formatted JSON in Insomnia.  The user also has access to POST, PUT, and DELETE routes to create, update, and delete data in the database. All of this can be seen using Insomnia.
